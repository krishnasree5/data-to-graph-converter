Data to Graph Converter

This project is a Python program that converts data into a bar graph, histogram, or pie chart. It uses the matplotlib.pyplot library.

Usage:
To use the program, first install the matplotlib library. Then, run the program and follow the prompts.

The program will first ask you to choose the type of graph you want to create. You can choose from a bar graph, histogram, or pie chart.

If you choose a bar graph, the program will ask you to enter the labels and frequencies of the data. It will then create a bar graph and display it.

If you choose a histogram, the program will ask you to enter the lower limits and upper limits of the data and also its frequency. It will then create a histogram and display it.

If you choose a pie chart, the program will ask you to enter the labels and values of the data. It will then create a pie chart and display it.
